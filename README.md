# Apprenticeship
We're really excited to have you onboard! This will be a fantastic opportunity to get to know iota and build a ton of practical skills. We'll get started by getting an idea of where your schooling and training has dropped you off to us and then find the next steps to get you acclimated to the typical day to day life as a developer.

**Our primary goal** is to build your skills such that when you start your first full time dev job, **you’ll be comfortable and be able to make an impact on the team**. There are a **ton** of ways we can do that and we look forward to seeing how it’ll all play out.

# Approach
We're hoping to give you a range of projects and tasks. Partially because it'll provide a broad array of options to learn. And partially because the biggest challenge of this program is that we're not going to be available to you throughout the day most days. You're going to be on a little bit of an island, to combat that we're going to have a multi-pronged curriculum. As we work together we’ll continue to grow and add to it.

You'll see [two projects (Fund Raising & Skill Development)](https://github.com/iotait/apprenticeship/projects) already setup in this repository, that's where we'll communicate about specific tasks/issues.

## Fund Raising
[Fund Raising](https://github.com/iotait/apprenticeship/projects/1) is a charity project we're interested in taking on and hope you can get off the ground for us. We're going to build a fund raising tool for schools that want to run various types of events to raise money for special projects. This is a fairly common thing, but we think we can do it with substantially lower costs so more money goes to the school rather than the companies that offer the service now.

This is a fantastically-sized project. It's not trivial, but it's also horrifically complex.

## Skill Development
[Skill Development](https://github.com/iotait/apprenticeship/projects/2) will have a number of skills to work on with tasks to complete. We started with a few things in there for now and as we progress we'll decide together what the next ones to work on will be

# Day 1 / Week 1
This will be new to all of us, so there's a lot to learn. The first day we'll get together for breakfast to get to know each other a bit and talk through all of this and more. After that, you'll dive on in to the projects on this board. I'll be trying to check in with you twice a day during the first week to see you're doing and knowing that earlier on there will be more questions. By Wednesday we'll have talked a few times and we'll start to form a better idea of the pace of tasks.

# Mentor Availability
Matt Zollinhofer is going to be your mentor. He's your go to for questions, concerns, or anytime you're just not sure about something. Anything really! You're certainly welcome to talk to anyone in the company, but he's the one who's expecting to work with you most closely. The two of you will work out the right communication patterns that work for both of you. We're expecting it to look something like a couple hours of talking/pairing/meeting Monday evenings. A few phone calls throughout the week at the beginning or end of work day. And a mid-week (Thursday?) get together for breakfast or afternoon coffee.

# Finally
Please, please keep in mind the goal of this program: to grow you as a developer. For us to know if we're doing that, we need you to answer genuinely (positively or negatively) when we check in with you to see if we’re meeting that goal or not. And of course, feel free to volunteer and concerns or questions if we haven’t asked at the right time. We certainly will be trying to ask you, but please know that we welcome your thoughts and feedback at any time.
